# PCA9685 Servo code for STM32 HAL

Can be used for simple control of SG90 servos connected to PCA9685-based boards

I've lost several hours figuring out how it works. This code was made so you would not have to

Tested on STM32F4-Disco (F407VGT6 version), but should work on any STM32 with I2C and HAL
